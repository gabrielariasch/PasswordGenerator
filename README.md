# PasswordGenerator

This code first imports the random module, which allows us to generate random numbers and sequences. Then, it prints a welcome message and asks the user how many letters, symbols, and numbers they would like in their password. The user's input is then used to create a list of characters that will be used to generate the password.

Next, the code uses a for loop to iterate through the list of characters and randomly select one character at a time. The selected characters are then added to a new list called password_list.

Once the password_list is complete, the code uses the random.shuffle() function to randomly shuffle the order of the characters in the list. This ensures that the password is not predictable.

Finally, the code creates a new string variable called password and uses a for loop to iterate through the password_list and add each character to the password string. The password string is then printed to the console.

This code is a simple way to generate a random password with a specified number of letters, symbols, and numbers. You can modify the code to add or remove different types of characters, or to change the length of the password.
